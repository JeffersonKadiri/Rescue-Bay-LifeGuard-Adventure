## Developer Description
Rescue bay was created for the 2023 LV. 99 Game Jam following the theme <bold>"Take a deep breath"</bold>. The game theme inspired me to write a game on a lifeguard as they usually jumping to save people lives while holding their breath for a very long period of time. All code, logic, and level design was done by me. And is free for use.
